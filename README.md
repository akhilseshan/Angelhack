 JustGO is a web app to easily searching buses running locally at a particular time. It is a collection of data of both KSRTC as well as private buses. 

 In the first phase of implementation, users will be allowed to add data of the buses with an algorithm to ensure correctness and accuracy. 

 The second phase enforces an admin control wherein the data can be approved by only by an official.
